# Eco-Friendly City Simulation with Python, OpenGL, and GLUT

Welcome to the Eco-Friendly City Simulation project! This project allows you to experience a virtual cityscape with buildings, trees, moving turbines, roads, cars, and dynamic day-night transitions. All elements of this simulation have been created from scratch using basic algorithms like Midpoint Line, Eight Way Symmetry, and Midpoint Circle.

## Features

- A 2D cityscape simulation created using Python, OpenGL, and GLUT.
- Buildings with realistic textures and varying heights.
- Trees and foliage that add to the eco-friendly vibe.
- Wind turbines that rotate dynamically.
- A network of roads with moving cars.
- Day-night transitions, including sunrise and sunset.
- The ability to switch between day and night views with a keyboard click.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- OpenGL
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

## Installation

To install and run the Eco-Friendly City Simulation on your system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/shihabshahrier/EcoFriendly_city.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd EcoFriendly_city
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   python eco_friendly_city.py
   ```

## Usage

Once you've followed the installation steps, you can use the simulation as follows:

1. After running the `main.py` script, the cityscape simulation will launch in a window.

2. To switch between day and night views, press the specified key (default: 'N'). Enjoy the dynamic day-night transitions!
